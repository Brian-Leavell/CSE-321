# Overview
This folder contains all of the files used and needed to implement the dot matrix array into your program. These files were not created by me, and the original Github that these
files were found in is linked in the README.md on the main project tab. 

*****All work is credited to the owner of that repository, and I am in no way attempting to pass this off as my own*****

Since there were too many files to list and upload, this is a simple receipt to show that external libraries will be needed.
